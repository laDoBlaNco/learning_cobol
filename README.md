# learning_cobol

My path learning the COBOL programming language. Though this seems a bit on the unorthodox 
crazy move, This seems like it'll be my backdoor into the tech and SWE world. I will spend
some time learning Cobol and IBM Mainframe management just to see if I can get a position
possibly just maintaining old code. The need is real and the prejudice against jurrasic 
languages is also unfortunately very real.

## My Goals
My goals with this project is really just to learn cobol and see if I can start to use it
as my doorway into a secure job in tech. But at the same time see what I can hack in the language. 
It's old, but from what I hear you can make it do anything. This will also help me focus on 
Unix and Linux. 

Though I'm just going through different videos and tutorials, I'm also adding in my thoughts to 
which helps me reason and understand about the language semantics.
